# export-fsm
Some code to export Finite States Machines (FSM) made on http://madebyevan.com/fsm/ to our Java framework and maybe to JSON

## Export to Java
The main goal is to export our drawn FSM from the website to the Java FSM framework made for our course, [JFSM from edesmontils](https://github.com/edesmontils/JFSM)

### TODO
- [ ] Read the localStorage.fsm (and understand the JSON format)
- [ ] Compose the Java code, log it in console
- [ ] Export directly a Java file

## Export to JSON
Try to export an easily JSON file, maybe create a Chrome extension to import and export with one button
